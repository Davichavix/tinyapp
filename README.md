# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users can add, modify and delete short URLs. The app will store a list of short URLs created by the user.

## App Features
- users can only modify and see their own URLs
- only registered users can create short URLs
- user can only register usernames once
- short URL links will work without being logged in as registered user
- password encrypted using bcrypt
- encrypted cookies are used to keep track of user sessions
